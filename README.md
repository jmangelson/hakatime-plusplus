# hakatime++

Hakatime++ is a fork of hakatime that incorporates the ability to manualy enter timing information and then correlate
that with automatically detected timing info (from wakatime clients). We also plan to add functionality for manual tracking
of tasks and goals.

Hakatime is a server implementation of [Wakatime](https://wakatime.com/). It provides a single API endpoint
(`/api/v1/users/current/heartbeats.bulk`) that the Wakatime client can use to send heartbeats containing info
about your coding activity.

It comes together with a simple dashboard which provides a graphical representation of the collected data.

## Features

- Total activity view.
- Per project activity view.
- User registration & login.
- Badge generation for a project (using shields.io compatible endpoint). [![my-app](https://hakatime-demo.mtx-dev.xyz/badge/svg/f8c0f834-3747-4d3f-965b-6fa08c6dea94?days=7)](https://hakatime-demo.mtx-dev.xyz/badge/svg/f8c0f834-3747-4d3f-965b-6fa08c6dea94?days=7)
- API token management.

## Demo

There is demo instance with fake data [here](https://hakatime-demo.mtx-dev.xyz).

Use `demo` as username and `demodemo` as password to login. You can create an API token and try sending your
data.

## Client setup

After you've generated a new API token from Hakatime's UI, update your `~/.wakatime.cfg` file like below:

```ini
[settings]
api_key=<generated_token>

# e.g api_url=https://hakatime-demo.mtx-dev.xyz/api/v1/users/current/heartbeats.bulk for the demo instance.
api_url=<hakatime_instance_url>/api/v1/users/current/heartbeats.bulk
```

The file's location might be different depending on your system and editor. Please consult the [client docs](https://wakatime.com/plugins)
for further information.

## Deployment

You can use the following docker-compose setup for testing locally or an actual
deployment. Change `HAKA_CORS_URL` to match the actual external endpoint of your
instance.

**NOTE**: Deploying on ARM is also possible using `mujx/hakatime:latest-arm64` for the `arm64` architecture
(builds on every commit) or with `mujx/hakatime:latest-arm` (manual semi-regular updates for `arm/v7` & `arm64`)
or by building the image yourself with the dedicated Dockerfile (`Dockerfile.arm`).

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  server:
    container_name: hakatime
    image: mujx/hakatime:latest
    environment:
      # DB settings.
      HAKA_DB_HOST: haka_db
      HAKA_DB_PORT: 5432
      HAKA_DB_NAME: test
      HAKA_DB_PASS: test
      HAKA_DB_USER: test
      # Server settings.
      HAKA_CORS_URL: "http://localhost:8080"
      HAKA_PORT: 8080
      HAKA_SHIELDS_IO_URL: "https://img.shields.io"
      HAKA_ENABLE_REGISTRATION: "true" # Toggle after you've created your account.
      # Number of hours after which inactive browser sessions will expire (login required).
      HAKA_SESSION_EXPIRY: "24"
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:8080:8080"
  haka_db:
    container_name: haka_db
    image: postgres:11-alpine
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: test
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: test
      POSTGRES_USER: test
    volumes:
      - ./docker/:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/
      - deploy_db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

volumes:
  deploy_db_data: {}
```

To start all the services run:

```bash
$ docker-compose -f ./docker-compose-deploy.yml up
```

and navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to access the UI.

## Building

### Server

Requirements:

- [GHC](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/) (tested with 8.8)
- [libpq](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/libpq.html) (for PostgreSQL bindings)
- [cabal-install](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/) (If building with cabal)

Using [nix](https://nixos.org/nix/) requires the least amount of manual intervention (installing packages etc)

#### nix

```bash
nix-build release.nix
```

#### cabal

```bash
cabal build
```

### Dashboard

Requirements:

- Node.js
- npm / yarn

```bash
cd dashboard

npm install # yarn install

npm run prod # Optimized build for production usage.

npm run dev # Development server with hot reloading.
```

## Running

### Database

The server needs a database to store its data, so we will have to create a PostgreSQL instance and initialize
it with the schema found in the [docker/](docker/) directory. You can use the provided solution using
docker-compose (`docker-compose up -d`) or do it manually, depending on your system.

### Server

Start the server and point it to the database.

```bash
# We assume that the docker-compose setup is used.
# Change these values according to your actual setup.
export HAKA_DB_USER=test
export HAKA_DB_PASS=test
export HAKA_DB_NAME=test
export HAKA_DB_HOST=localhost
export HAKA_DB_PORT=5432

hakatime run
```

### Dashboard

1. Point your browser to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
2. Create a new user.
3. Create an API token and set up your Wakatime client with it.
